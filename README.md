This is compiled version of Kalibrate HackRF for windows

You may need to install HackRF to your PC, I have just installed GNU Radio 3.8.2 it was enough.

Download the code run the one.exe on the command window such as >one.exe -s GSM900
as it happens >kal.exe -s GSM900

whole code is taken from kalibrate HackRF program from https://github.com/scateu/kalibrate-hackrf
